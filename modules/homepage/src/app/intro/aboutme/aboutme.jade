.about-me
  p I work as an independent consultant (my homepage : http://nishants.site ). I love ideating, prototyping, coaching and mentoring. I have great skills at creating pixel perfect user interface of web, and am crazy about design and user experience.. I have over 10,000 hours of programming experience across the development stacks (Java / Ruby backends, Angular/Jquery/SCSS frontends, test automation with ruby and java). In my last assignment as a coach, I introduced the practice of acceptance tests driven development at an account in Mphasis, coaching multiple teams, creating architecture and establishing best practices. I can design and  implement custom widgets and interactions, that can run at 60 frames per second in browsers.
